        Different factors affect skin absorption, including how much is applied,
        the physical state of the product (is it a liquid, powder, gel, etc.),
        where on the body it is applied, how large of an area the product is
        applied to, the person’s age, and whether the skin is wet or dry at the
        time the product is applied. Often, only 1 or 2% of an applied dose is
        absorbed into your system. But sometimes, more is absorbed, especially
        if your skin has open wounds, cracks etc. or if you have a skin
        condition such as eczema. In fact, how “complete” your skin is can be
        the most important factor in determining how effective a barrier it can
        be to topical products. It can be hard to get good safety information on
        every type of topical product. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
        does require cosmetic products to be “safe,” which is based on their
        specific labeling and use. Yet cosmetic products do not need FDA
        approval to be sold on the market, and often the companies make claims
        that have not been studied and cannot be proven. So it is always a good
        idea to check with our MotherToBaby information specialists and let us
        research the product and its ingredients for you. Many times during
        pregnancy and breastfeeding, people worry about the use of retinoids (a
        class of chemical compounds contained in treatments for acne, psoriasis,
        wrinkles, and other skin conditions), high dose salicylic acid (a common
        ingredient in topical acne treatments), formaldehyde (often used as a
        preservative in cosmetic products), hydroquinone (a skin-lightening
        agent that can be used to treat age spots and sun spots), and chemical
        sunscreens to name a few. These products do have some concerns and
        should be used with caution when pregnant and nursing. Other products
        that are applied to your skin have less concerns in most instances.
        These include over-the-counter antibiotic creams, corticosteroid creams
        (used to reduce skin inflammation and irritation from things insect
        bites or poison oak/ivy, but also in treatments for eczema and
        psoriasis), essential oils, menthol and lidocaine type products (used in
        products to cool or numb the skin), hydrogen peroxide (used in
        treatments for acne, sun spots, and age spots), fluoride and dental
        products, homeopathic creams and gels, vitamin C products (used in
        treatments to reduce fine lines and as an antioxidant to protect the
        skin), and things that you put on your hair and nails. So that is the
        skinny on skin care! You might be able to use more products on your skin
        than you thought you could during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Even with
        a product that is considered low risk, you may want to check with your
        healthcare provider or with us if you have any concerns before using. We
        have a number of fact sheets and blogs that can answer some of your
        questions about topical products, and our information specialists are
        always happy to answer your questions by phone, text, email, or chat.
