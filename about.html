    <div class="aboutContent content">
      MotherToBaby, a service of the non-profit Organization of Teratology
      Information Specialists (OTIS), is the nation’s leading authority and most
      trusted source of evidence-based information on the safety of medications
      and other exposures during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. We
      specialize in answering questions about the safety/risk of exposures, such
      as medications, vaccines, chemicals, herbal products, substances of abuse,
      maternal health conditions and much more, during pregnancy or
      breastfeeding. Our no-cost information service is available to mothers,
      health professionals, and the general public via chat, text, phone, and
      email in both English and Spanish. MotherToBaby is a suggested resource by
      many agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Women’s Health.
      More than 100,000 women and their health providers seek information about
      birth defects prevention from OTIS and MotherToBaby every year. We also
      conduct state-of-the-art observational research on the safety of
      medications and vaccines in pregnancy. 9 out of 10 pregnant women in the
      United States take medication but evidence on the safety of many
      medications during pregnancy is often lacking. Our observational
      MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies aim to provide this much-needed information
      so pregnant women and their health providers can make more informed
      treatment decisions. Read more about the history, vision, mission, goals,
      leadership and funding of our parent organization, OTIS. Our Affiliates
      The MotherToBaby network consists of 14 affiliates housed at acclaimed
      universities and hospitals across the United States and Canada. These
      affiliates provide the MotherToBaby service to people living in all 50
      U.S. states, the U.S. territories, and the province of Quebec in Canada.
      We encourage you to find your affiliate and to connect with the team that
      is working to reduce the chance of preventable birth defects in your
      community.
